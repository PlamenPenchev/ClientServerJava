# ClientServerJava
This is a project I've made for my University course - OOP with Java. It is a simple multithreaded client server program with UI on the client side. A client connects to the server where he can browse an ArrayList of a custom type in order to add more items or read it. Threads fight over the shared resource are managed and synchronized.
This project is based on my previous project - <a href="https://github.com/PlamenPenchev/JavaOOPFarmModel">JavaOOPFarmModel</a>.
Currently the user can add and browse the list but all the files are provided so the project can be extended so clients can save the list
into file, sort it etc.
